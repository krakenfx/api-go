## üìÇ Examples & Scripts

Example packages using the module are located in the [examples](examples/) directory

### üåê Environment Configuration

Before running the scripts, you'll need to set the following environment variables to configure API endpoints and authentication keys:

```bash
# REST and WebSocket URLs for Kraken Spot API
export KRAKEN_API_SPOT_REST_URL="https://api.kraken.com"
export KRAKEN_API_SPOT_WS_URL="wss://ws.kraken.com/v2"
export KRAKEN_API_SPOT_WS_AUTH_URL="wss://ws-auth.kraken.com/v2"
export KRAKEN_API_SPOT_PUBLIC=""    # Insert your Spot public API key
export KRAKEN_API_SPOT_SECRET=""    # Insert your Spot secret API key

# REST and WebSocket URLs for Kraken Futures API
export KRAKEN_API_FUTURES_REST_URL="https://futures.kraken.com"
export KRAKEN_API_FUTURES_WS_URL="wss://futures.kraken.com/ws/v1"
export KRAKEN_API_FUTURES_PUBLIC=""  # Insert your Futures public API key
export KRAKEN_API_FUTURES_SECRET=""  # Insert your Futures secret API key
```

### üîê Running Authenticated Examples

To simplify execution of authenticated example scripts, use the provided helper script:

```bash
./scripts/run prod ./examples/spotrest/recenttrades
```

This command sets the correct environment and runs the selected script with authentication enabled.
